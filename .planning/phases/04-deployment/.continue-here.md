<current_state>
Planning Phase 4 (Deployment) was initiated but interrupted before any PLAN.md files were created. The phase directory exists and CONTEXT.md is ready. The gsd-planner agent was about to be spawned — that's the exact next step.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 3 (Design & CMS) — 100% complete (2/2 plans)
- Phase 4 context gathered via /gsd:discuss-phase — 04-CONTEXT.md written
- /gsd:plan-phase 4 --skip-research initiated: init ran, phase validated, context loaded

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Spawn gsd-planner for Phase 4 to create PLAN.md files in .planning/phases/04-deployment/
- Run gsd-plan-checker to verify the plans
- Execute Phase 4

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Deploy to Vercel (not GitHub Pages)
- GitHub OAuth for Decap CMS authentication in production
- Auto-deploy on push to main
- Phase delivers config and build setup only — user connects repo manually via Vercel dashboard/CLI
- Static export strategy and OAuth handler implementation left to Claude's discretion during planning/execution

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 4 is the final phase: export the Next.js site as a static build, deploy to Vercel, and configure Decap CMS with GitHub OAuth. Context is fully captured in 04-CONTEXT.md. Research was intentionally skipped (--skip-research flag used). The planner just needs to read CONTEXT.md + ROADMAP.md + REQUIREMENTS.md and produce DEPL-01 and DEPL-02 plans.

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:plan-phase 4 --skip-research
(Picks up exactly where we left off — the planner will be spawned fresh)
</next_action>
