## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made
- 4-phase structure for "quick" depth delivery
- Combined Design & CMS into single phase (both depend on core display)
- Deployment as final phase (depends on complete content management)

### Blockers
- None yet

### Notes
- Mobile-first design critical for facilitator use case
- Static site export required for Vercel/GH Pages deployment
- Decap CMS provides git-based admin without external database

## Session Continuity

**Next Action:** Awaiting roadmap approval from user

**To Continue:** `/gsd-plan-phase 1` once roadmap approved
