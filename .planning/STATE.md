## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made
- 4-phase structure for "quick" depth delivery
- Combined Design & CMS into single phase (both depend on core display)
- Deployment as final phase (depends on complete content management)
- Used git-gateway backend for Netlify/Vercel compatibility
- Embedded CMS via iframe for seamless Next.js integration

### Blockers
- None

### Notes
- Mobile-first design critical for facilitator use case
- Static site export required for Vercel/GH Pages deployment
- Decap CMS provides git-based admin without external database
