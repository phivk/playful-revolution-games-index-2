- Combined Design & CMS into single phase (both depend on core display)
- Deployment as final phase (depends on complete content management)

### Blockers
- None

### Notes
- Mobile-first design critical for facilitator use case
- Static site export required for Vercel/GH Pages deployment
- Decap CMS provides git-based admin without external database
