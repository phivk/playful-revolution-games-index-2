A classic team puzzle that requires communication and problem-solving.

**How to play:**

1. Stand in a circle and move closer and closer until you can't get any closer
2. Close your eyes
3. Put one arm up, then the other
4. Wave your arms around and find two different empty hands to hold
5. Open your eyes

Now, can you untangle yourselves back into the circle you started in? The challenge is to unwind the human knot without letting go of any hands.

Communication and patience are key to solving this puzzle together.
