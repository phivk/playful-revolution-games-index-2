A high-energy variation of rock-paper-scissors with a crowd-building twist.

**How to play:**
Players pair up for rock-paper-scissors battles. The loser becomes a supporter of the winner and cheers them on in their next battle. Winners keep finding new opponents while their crowd of supporters grows.

The game continues until there are only two players left, each with a massive crowd of supporters cheering them on for the final showdown.
