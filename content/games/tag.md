The ancient game that can be traced back to prehistoric hunter-gatherer times.

This universal folk game is known by many names and has countless variations across cultures. At its core, it's simple: one person is "it" and must tag another player to transfer that role.

**Variations to try:**

- Freeze tag: tagged players must freeze until freed by another player
- Chain tag: tagged players join hands with "it" to form a growing chain
- Tunnel tag: frozen players make an arch that others can crawl through to free them
- Shadow tag: instead of touching, you must step on someone's shadow

A timeless game that never fails to get energy flowing.
