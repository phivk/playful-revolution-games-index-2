A mysterious game from the New Games Movement - nobody knows exactly how to pronounce it!

**How to play:**
1. One player starts as the "Prui"
2. Everyone walks around the room with their eyes closed
3. When you meet someone, shake hands and say "Prui!"
4. If they say "Prui" back, let go and find someone else
5. If they say nothing back, you've found the Prui! Hold onto their hand and become part of it
6. When someone finds you and shakes your free hand, stay silent - they're now part of the Prui too

Gradually, a large "Prui blob" forms as more and more people find and join it.

The entire game is played with eyes closed, making it a unique sensory experience of finding connection in the dark.
