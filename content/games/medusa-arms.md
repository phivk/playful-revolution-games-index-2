A new favorite partner game combining evasion with staying centered.

**How to play:**
1. One person stands still, swaying their arms randomly in a sweeping motion
2. Their partner aims to always stay within the center of the "medusa" - close to their torso
3. But they must avoid the swaying arms!
4. Don't be afraid to actually strike your partner (gently) - this keeps them alert
5. Switch roles
6. Advanced: Try with eyes closed

This game develops spatial awareness, reflexes, and the ability to stay calm while under mild threat.
