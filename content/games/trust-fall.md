The classic trust-building exercise with an advanced variation.

**Basic version:**
Stand at arm's length from your partner, turn around, and close your eyes. Fall backwards and trust your partner to catch you.

**Advanced version:**
Combine with the Flocking game - while moving through space as a flock, suddenly transition into a trust fall with whoever is behind you. This takes the exercise to a whole new level of awareness and trust.
