A turn-based action game of swift attacks and evasions.

**How to play:**
1. Players stand in a circle and place their hands together
2. The leader says "Niiinja!" and everyone strikes a pose
3. Taking turns clockwise, each player makes a single fluid motion to try to hit another player's arm
4. The defending player can make one move to evade
5. If hit on the arm, that arm is bound behind the body
6. When both arms are hit, the player is out
7. Players freeze after their move and stay in that position until their next turn

Last ninja standing wins! The game combines statue-like stillness with explosive bursts of movement.
