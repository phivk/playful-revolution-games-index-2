A clowning-inspired exercise focused on transmitting energy to the group.

This exercise comes from the world of clowning, where the primary goal is transmitting a specific energy to the audience.

**How to play:**
Standing in a circle, take turns going around. Each person improvises a movement with a sound, and then the entire group copies it together.

Pay close attention to the posture and physicality of the person - try to copy it as accurately as possible, not just the movement and sound but the full embodiment of their energy.
