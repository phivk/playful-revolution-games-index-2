A movement warm-up using animal postures and movements.

**Animal positions to explore:**

- **Meerkat (Stokstaartje):** Stand tall and alert, scanning the horizon
- **Downward Dog:** Classic yoga pose, hands and feet on ground, hips high
- **Tiger:** Move on all fours, stalking and prowling
- **Donkey Stretch (Ezeltje Strekt Je):** Kick back like a donkey
- **Flamingo:** Balance on one leg

Move through the space embodying each animal. Feel how each posture affects your breath, energy, and awareness. This warm-up engages the whole body and activates playful imagination.
