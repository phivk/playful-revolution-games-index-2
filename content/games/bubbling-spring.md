A grounding practice inspired by traditional Chinese medicine, focusing on the Yongquan point.

**How to play:**
1. Stand with a slight bend in your knees
2. You may start to feel a gentle shake in your legs - allow it
3. From the bottom of your feet, let the shake grow bigger
4. Feel the surge of energy it can give you from the ground up
5. Breathing in: feel the energy coming upward
6. Breathing out: feel it subsiding

This practice connects you to the earth through the "bubbling spring" point (Yongquan) on the sole of each foot, believed in Chinese medicine to be where earth energy enters the body.
