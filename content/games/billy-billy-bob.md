A theatre sports game that combines quick thinking with group poses.

**Basic game:**
1. One person stands in the middle of the circle
2. They point at someone and say "Billy-Billy-Bob"
3. The target must say "Bob" at the exact same time as the person in the middle
4. If they miss the timing, they go to the middle

**Add poses (the real fun):**
Instead of "Billy-Billy-Bob," the person in the middle can call out poses. The target and the two people beside them must quickly form the pose together.

Example poses:
- **James Bond:** Center person strikes a pose, neighbors say "Oh, James!"
- **Washing Machine:** Center person spins, neighbors hold them from the sides
- **Wedding:** Center is the couple, neighbors are guests crying with joy
- **Toaster:** Center jumps up, neighbors form the toaster
- **Elephant:** Center makes trunk with arms, neighbors form big ears

Anyone who messes up goes to the middle. Invent your own poses!
