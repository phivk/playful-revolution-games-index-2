A guaranteed warm-up game with partner coordination and celebration.

If you're not warm after this, nothing will get you warm!

**How to play:**
1. Find a partner roughly the same height
2. Stand across from each other at arm's length
3. Slap the top of your legs with your hands
4. Send your arms in any direction: up, left, or right
5. Slap back on your legs
6. If you and your partner chose the same direction, follow with a high-ten in front!

The random matching creates moments of surprise and celebration when you sync up with your partner.
