A hand-sign coordination game perfect for seated groups.

**How to play:**
1. Players take turns ordering a "sushi" item from the menu
2. Each menu item has a corresponding hand sign
3. All other players must quickly join in by making the correct hand sign
4. When the ordering player is satisfied, they say "Itadakimasu!" (meaning "I humbly receive" in Japanese)
5. If you can't make the right hand sign in time, you lose that hand
6. Keep playing until only one player remains

The game requires memorizing hand signs and quick reactions. Start simple and add more complex items as players learn the menu.
