A balance-testing duel where you can only touch your opponent's hands.

**How to play:**
1. Find a partner roughly the same height
2. Stand across from each other at arm's length
3. Put your feet together (and keep them together!)
4. Try to make your opponent step or fall by pushing their hands only

You can only touch the other person's hands - use timing, feints, and strategy to throw them off balance while maintaining your own stability.

The game teaches balance, anticipation, and controlled aggression.
