A gentle spinal movement practice also known as spinal waves.

**How to play:**
Focus on moving your spine in spiral patterns, letting the movement flow from one vertebra to the next.

Start small and gradually increase the range of motion. Let the spiral movement travel:
- From your tailbone up through your spine
- Through your neck and head
- Back down again

This mobilization technique warms up the spine, releases tension, and develops body awareness. It can be done standing, seated, or on hands and knees.
