A partner exercise developing sensitivity to touch and movement leadership.

**Round 1 - Follower responds to touch:**
1. Partner A places their hand between Partner B's shoulder blades
2. Partner B moves their shoulder blades toward and away from the hand
3. Partner A explores: how far can the body come and go?
4. Partner B stays completely present to where the hand leads them
5. Switch roles

**Round 2 - Leader follows mover:**
1. Move around the space freely
2. The tables have turned: the mover (B) is now the leader
3. The toucher (A) follows, keeping contact with their back
4. Look for the extremes, put your partner to the test
5. Switch roles

This exercise develops somatic awareness and nonverbal communication.
