A balance and sabotage game where you protect your "turtle" while attacking others.

**How to play:**
1. Stand in a circle with fingertips of one hand nearly touching in the middle
2. Balance your "turtle" (a small object) on top of this hand
3. The goal: be the last one standing with your turtle still balanced

Use your free hand to try and knock others' turtles off their hands. You can only touch other players' hands - any other contact is a foul and they get to recover their turtle.

Strategy involves both protecting your own turtle and finding the right moment to strike at others.
