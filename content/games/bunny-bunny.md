description: The Bunny Bunny game is a fast-paced, rhythmic circle game, where

Setup: Players stand in a circle and establish a steady beat (e.g., clapping, hitting knees).

Actions: The person with the "bunny" makes a chomping motion with their hands toward themselves while saying "Bunny Bunny" twice.

Passing: Without breaking rhythm, that person passes the bunny to another player by pointing and saying "Bunny Bunny".

Sides: The people on the immediate left and right of the person with the bunny must shout "Toki Toki" while doing a dance, encouraging the main player to mess up.

Elimination: Anyone who breaks the rhythm, forgets to chant, or misses their turn is eliminated.
