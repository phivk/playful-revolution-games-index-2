A mindfulness practice for developing body awareness.

**How to play:**
Notice how you feel in this moment. Envision a horizontal plane moving through your body from top to bottom, pausing to observe each area:

- Crown of your head
- Face
- Neck
- Shoulders
- Shoulder blades
- Upper back
- Ribcage
- Belly
- Lower back
- Hips
- Seat
- Thighs
- Knees
- Shins
- Top of feet
- Bottom of feet

Do this at the beginning and end of a session to notice the difference. This practice grounds participants and builds interoceptive awareness.
