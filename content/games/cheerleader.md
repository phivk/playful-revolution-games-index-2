An improvisation exercise that challenges cognitive spontaneity and self-expression.

**How to play:**
When it's your turn, announce yourself by choosing an adjective for each letter of your first name. For example, if your name is "Sam" you might say "Spectacular, Amazing, Magnificent SAM!"

The challenge: don't think ahead about what you'll say. Wait until it's your turn and see what comes to mind in the moment. Whatever comes out, commit to it fully and make the most of it!

This exercise builds spontaneity, self-confidence, and the ability to perform under pressure.
