A foundational ball game for group coordination and focus.

**How to play:**
Stand in a circle and pass one or more balls around the group. Start simple, then add variations:

- Call someone's name before passing to them
- Add more balls to increase complexity
- Change direction unexpectedly
- Use different types of passes (bounce, overhead, behind the back)
- Try passing in patterns rather than around the circle

This game builds hand-eye coordination, attention, and group awareness.
