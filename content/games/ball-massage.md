A relaxing circle game that combines gentle physical contact with group connection.

**How to play:**
Standing in a circle, each person uses a ball to gently massage the back or shoulders of the person in front of them while receiving a massage from the person behind.

The simultaneous giving and receiving creates a loop of care throughout the group. This game works well as a cool-down or bonding activity.
