A fast-paced theatre sports game combining sound, movement, and quick reactions.

**How to play:**
1. Stand in a circle
2. Someone starts by "attacking" another player by pointing at them and yelling "HI!"
3. The defending person puts up their arms and yells "HA!"
4. The two people on either side of the defender "attack" their stomach, yelling "HO!"
5. The original defender then attacks someone else with "HI!" and the pattern continues

If you make a mistake, you may dramatically "die" onto the floor (optional fun rule).

The game requires constant alertness and creates a rhythmic, energetic flow around the circle.
