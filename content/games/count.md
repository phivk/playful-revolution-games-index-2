A group synchronization game that builds energy and presence through counting.

Stand in a circle. Count to ten using "popcorn" style - anyone can say the next number, but if two people speak at once, start over.

Once you've succeeded, try variations:
- Say it like you mean it
- Say it like you know kung fu
- Try different emotions or characters

This simple exercise builds group awareness and can serve as an energizer or focus activity.
