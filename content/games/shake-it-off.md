A simple but powerful movement warm-up that releases tension and energizes.

**How to play:**
Shake it like a Polaroid picture! Spend 3 minutes shaking your entire body.

Work through body parts:
- Head
- Arms
- Torso
- Hips
- Legs
- Feet

Let the shaking build in intensity, then gradually wind down. Follow with a brief shavasana (lying still) to feel the contrast and let the energy settle.

This technique is used in many movement traditions to release physical and emotional tension.
