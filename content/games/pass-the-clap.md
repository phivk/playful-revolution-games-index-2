A rhythm and reaction game that builds group synchronization.

**How to play:**
Standing in a circle, one person starts by turning to face their neighbor and clapping at the same time as them. That person then turns to face their other neighbor and passes the clap along.

The clap travels around the circle. As the group gets better, try to speed up while maintaining the synchronization. Variations can include changing direction or sending multiple claps around the circle.
