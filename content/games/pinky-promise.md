A playful duel game that tests agility and awareness. (Playtest version)

**How to play:**
1. Stand at arm's length from your opponent
2. Interlock one pinky with theirs - this connection must remain throughout the game
3. Use your free hand to try to touch your opponent's nose-tip
4. First one to touch wins!

**Fouls:**
- Putting your pinky in your mouth = lose
- Putting your pinky in your opponent's eye = lose

A simple but engaging game that creates funny contortions as players try to protect their nose while attacking.
