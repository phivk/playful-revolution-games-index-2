A high-energy synchronized hopping game that builds rhythm and coordination.

**How to play:**
Stand in a circle with arms stretched to the side. Touch flat hands with the people beside you. Now hop in a circle together following this pattern:

- 8 hops left
- 8 hops right
- 4 hops left, 4 hops right
- 2 hops left, 2 hops right
- 1 left, 1 right, 1 left, 1 right

The tempo naturally increases as the numbers get smaller, creating an exciting build-up.
