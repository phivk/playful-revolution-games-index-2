A high-energy movement game inspired by the mesmerizing behavior of birds in flight.

Watch how fascinating birds are when they fly - going at full speed, seemingly not heading anywhere in particular, but moving with purpose, seeking each other out, staying together while traveling at high speed.

**How to play:**
Move through the space at a high pace. Look for each other, stay together as a group, but don't crash. The goal is to maintain awareness of the whole flock while moving quickly and fluidly through the space.

This game develops spatial awareness, peripheral vision, and group cohesion.
