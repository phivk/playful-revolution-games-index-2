A flowing connection game where you continuously transfer handshakes between participants.

Think of it this way: you shake hands with someone and you aren't allowed to stop shaking hands or let go until you are shaking hands with someone else (with your other hand). Then you let go with the first hand and let it find a third person, and so on.

The game creates a constant flow of connections throughout the group, encouraging participants to stay aware of their surroundings and move through the space while maintaining physical contact.
