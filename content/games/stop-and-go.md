A movement game using animal embodiment and partner direction.

**How to play:**
1. Choose one of the animals from the Animal Warm-up (meerkat, downward dog, tiger)
2. Move around the space embodying your chosen animal
3. Your partner tells you when to stop or go

This simple structure creates an exploration of how each animal moves, freezes, and responds to external cues.

The game develops body awareness, impulse control, and creative movement.
