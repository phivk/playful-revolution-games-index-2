A playful improvisation game that creates instant connections between strangers.

**How to play:**
Move around the space in a slow flock. When your eyes lock with someone, create a secret handshake together - but execute it like you've been doing it for years.

The magic is in the commitment: act as if this elaborate greeting is something you've shared a thousand times. This creates instant inside jokes and connections between participants.
