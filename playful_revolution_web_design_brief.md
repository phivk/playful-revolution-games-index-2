# Playful Revolution — Web Design Brief

## 1. Purpose & Audience
Playful Revolution is a movement to re‑kindle playfulness in daily life through **physical, social, and spontaneous games and interactive exercises**. The website should:
- Feel like an *invitation to play*, not a corporate homepage
- Be approachable for curious adults (educators, facilitators, creatives, community builders)
- Signal *movement + participation*, not passive consumption

Primary action: **Join / Participate / Try a game**
Secondary actions: **Learn more, explore exercises, connect**

---

## 2. Core Brand Traits (Non‑negotiable)
Use these as a checklist for every design decision:
- **Playful, not childish**
- **Bold, human, tactile**
- **Rebellious but kind**
- **Improvised, not polished**
- **Collective energy over individual heroics**

If something feels too clean, too symmetrical, or too quiet — it’s probably wrong.

---

## 3. Overall Visual Vibe
Think:
- Street‑poster energy
- Protest + playground
- Zine meets festival signage
- Hand‑made, slightly rough, expressive

Avoid:
- Corporate startup aesthetics
- Minimalist SaaS layouts
- Stock photography
- Over‑refined animations

The logo (a clenched hand holding a multicolored patchwork ball) should act as a **tone‑setter**: tension + joy, grip + play.

---

## 4. Color Palette
Inspired directly by the logo.

### Primary Colors (use boldly)
- **Revolution Red** – #E53935
- **Play Green** – #43A047
- **Joy Yellow** – #FDD835
- **Deep Blue** – #1E3A8A

These colors should:
- Appear in *blocks*, not subtle gradients
- Be mixed together unapologetically
- Occasionally clash — that’s okay

### Neutrals
- **Off‑White / Paper** – #FAFAF7
- **Ink Black** – #111111

Avoid pure white backgrounds everywhere; prefer paper‑like warmth.

---

## 5. Typography

### Primary Display Font (Headlines)
Choose a **bold, condensed or chunky sans‑serif** with character.
Good options:
- Bebas Neue
- Anton
- Oswald
- Archivo Black

Usage:
- ALL CAPS often welcome
- Slightly tight line‑height
- Big, poster‑style headlines

### Secondary / Body Font
A highly readable humanist sans‑serif:
- Inter
- Source Sans 3
- Work Sans

Usage:
- Comfortable reading
- Generous line spacing
- Avoid overly small text

### Accent Typography (Optional but encouraged)
For quotes, calls to action, or game titles:
- Handwritten or marker‑style font (sparingly)
- Use like graffiti or annotation, not body copy

---

## 6. Layout & Spacing

### Grid
- Use a **simple column grid**, but don’t feel enslaved by it
- Allow elements to break the grid occasionally

### Spacing Principles
- Big margins, big gestures
- Sections should feel like *zones* or *stages*
- White space = breathing room between moments of intensity

### Sections
Each section should answer *one clear question*:
- What is this?
- How does it work?
- Can I try something right now?

---

## 7. Graphic Design Elements

### Shapes & Motifs
- Circles, blobs, torn‑paper edges
- Patchwork / stitched shapes (echoing the ball in the logo)
- Hand‑drawn arrows, underlines, frames

### Texture
- Subtle paper grain
- Print‑like imperfections
- Light noise is welcome

### Dividers
- Thick lines
- Zig‑zags
- Dashed or hand‑drawn separators

Avoid thin hairline dividers.

---

## 8. Iconography

Style:
- Simple, bold, hand‑drawn or woodcut‑like
- Slightly imperfect strokes
- Filled shapes preferred over outlines

Icons should feel like they could be stamped with ink.

---

## 9. Imagery & Media

Preferred:
- Photos of real people playing, moving, interacting
- Slight motion blur, candid moments
- Imperfect framing

If illustration is used:
- Flat, bold colors
- Limited shading
- Strong silhouettes

Avoid:
- Corporate team photos
- Over‑posed smiles
- Glossy stock imagery

---

## 10. Interaction & Motion

Motion should feel:
- Snappy
- Responsive
- Slightly surprising

Examples:
- Buttons that *jump*, not fade
- Hover states with small rotations or shifts
- Elements that feel touchable

No slow, elegant fades. This is not a luxury brand.

---

## 11. Buttons & Calls to Action

Buttons should:
- Be big
- Be bold
- Use strong color contrast

Copy examples:
- “Play now”
- “Try this game”
- “Join the movement”
- “Let’s go”

Avoid passive language like “Learn more” unless necessary.

---

## 12. Accessibility (Important)
- High color contrast
- Large tap targets
- Clear focus states
- Motion should never block usability

Playful does not mean exclusionary.

---

## 13. Implementation Notes for Developer

- Prioritize speed and simplicity
- CSS should allow intentional roughness (rotation, offset, overlap)
- Avoid over‑engineering animations
- Design should still work with content changes

If in doubt, ask: *“Does this feel like an invitation to play?”*

---

## 14. Final Gut Check

The site should feel like:
- A poster you want to tear off the wall and take home
- A friend grabbing your arm saying: *“Come, try this”*
- A small act of joyful rebellion

If it feels too safe, push it further.
